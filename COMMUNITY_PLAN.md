我们的产品已上线，例如，范玮琪，吉克俊逸等众多明星艺人均已开通了他们的社群应用。这些应用可以快速移植到到波场公链上。与波场的系统完成对接后，我们即可开始以下社区支持计划，我们的目标是使波场成为最先落地的公链。共建社区的成功，才是D2F的成功。

为每个波场超级节点，开通属于自己的共识价值社区Dapp。
每个波场节点都可以使用我们的系统，向他们的用户提供Dapp。我们的系统将开源。
凡是使用D2FApp的社群，都可以每年获得D2F的代币奖励。具体奖励计划另行公布。我们将基于波场公链开发侧链。
年内100个以上的明星艺人Dapp上线。基于粉丝效应，辐射用户超过1亿。
“哈希之眼”是区块链智能硬件生态的第一个产品，我们计划推出波场版本。

The moment our product was rolled out, many celebrities and artists such as Fan Weiqi (Christine Fan) and Jike Junyi (Summer) opened their community apps. These apps can be swiftly transferred to the TRON public blockchain. After connecting these apps to TRON, we can start the following community support plan and achieve our goal of making TRON the first implemented public blockchain. To D2F, its real success is to make co-built community a success.

To open its own consensus value community Dapp for every TRON supernode.
And to make it a reality that every TRON node can use our system and provide Dapps to their users. Our system will be the open source.
Any communities that use D2F App will get token rewards from D2F each year. The specific rewarding plan will be released separately. We will develop sidechains as well based on TRON public blockchain.
During the year, more than 100 celebrities and artists have launched their Dapps. Thanks to the fan base, 100 million users are covered.
"Hash's Eye" is the first product out of the blockchain smart hardware ecosystem that is to see its TRON version launched soon.
