请在Appstone搜索“波场圈”App，这是我们为TRON未来节点们开发的一款共识价值社区Dapp。每一个节点每一个社群都可以生成各具特色和功能的Dapp。

北京每日互联科技有限公司以下简称D2F团队致力于Dapp生态和基于区块链的智能硬件开发。我们的多款Dapp已上线，区块链智能硬件“哈希之眼”也将在8月开启公测。

D2F认为在公链的初级阶段，一步到位的把所有功能及数据部署在区块链上还需要一定时间及公链的支持。可以先解决去中心化应用中的流量问题和用户体验。D2F的路径是先保证每个应用都是纯粹的去中心化应用，都是未来的分布式社群流量入口。然后跟随公链技术的成熟，逐步向公链迁移。

虽然以微信为代表的社交App加人很方便，但松散的关系使社群的活跃度少有超过5%的，微信群更像是导流工具，它是一个社群雏形的寄居地。

D2F提出的：媒体＋社群＋通证＝共识价值社区Dapp模式，可以使公链应用快速落地。让波场直达他的粉丝，会使波场具有更广泛的公众影响力。同时也能使TRON成为全球发展最快的共识价值社区。

Please search for "TRON Circle" App which is a consensus value community Dapp developed for future nodes of TRON. Every node and every community can create Dapps with its own characteristics and functions.

Direct to Fans Co.ltd, hereinafter referred to as the D2F Team, is dedicated to the Dapp ecology and developing smart hardware based on blockchain. Several Dapps have been launched already and the open beta of the blockchain hardware named "Hash's eye" will also start in August.
D2F believes that in the preliminary stage of public blockchain, deploying all functions and data onto the blockchain at one shot still needs a certain time and support from the public blockchain. The first thing that can be done is to solve the traffic issue of decentralized apps and the matter of user experience. The approach that D2F takes is to first ensure every app is purely decentralized and is the traffic portal for the future distributed communities. And then gradually migrate to public blockchain as public blockchain technology matures. 
Although social Apps like Wechat makes it easy to add people, the loose relations among people put the activeness of communities mostly below 5%. So Wechat group is more like a traffic diversion tool, a habitat of rudimentary communities.
The model of media + community + token=consensus value community Dapp, which D2F proposed can increase the speed in which public blockchain apps are implemented. It can allow TRON to directly reach its fans and give TRON wider public influence. Besides, it can also make TRON the fastest growing consensus value community in the world.
